MAGINE documentation
====================
Welcome to MAGINEs documentation. MAGINE was created to help organize and analyze modern high throughput data.
Specifically, we designed it for multi-sample (time series, drug dose, experimental conditions) and multiple omics platform (RNAseq, ph-silac, silac, label-free, metabolomics).
The tools are designed to organize and explore raw data.
- Organize data
- Automate enrichment analysis
- Enable sample series enrichment exploration
- Integrate network and enrichment analysis

MAGINE environment.


MAGINE has four main modules
    - Data
    - Enrichment
    - Networks
    - Tools

Our Data classes are built to organize and facilate exploration for both the raw data and the analysis.
The data class is the central structure that enables this.
